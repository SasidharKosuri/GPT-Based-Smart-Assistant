# GPT-Based-Smart-Assistant
This project is a voice-controlled AI assistant that integrates OpenAI's API with speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities. The assistant listens to user commands, generates responses using OpenAI's GPT model, and speaks the response aloud. It also supports specific actions like opening websites based on voice commands.
